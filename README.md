# Foundry VTT - Z-Scatter

Automatically force snap tokens in the same square, for better token management in the grid.

## Installation

In the setup screen, use the manifest URL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elizeuangelo/fvtt-module-z-scatter/master/module.json to install the module.

## How to Use

There is a new Token Control called "Size Snap" wich can be toggled by the DM.
When activated, you can put multiple tokens of the same size in the same space in the grid, and the module will acomodate them in a ordenable manner.
